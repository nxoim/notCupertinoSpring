# What?
Cupertino flavored Compose Multiplatform spring constructors that are familiar to iOS developers.

# Why?
1. For funzies
2. Brain cell gain
3. Someone probably was looking for something like this for compose 
4. i'm pretty sure no one else did this?

# Is it accurate?
I mean it seems like it. Specs seem to behave as expected.
I also edited the overscroll effect implementation to feel more accurate.
